# Atlas — Explore With Purpose  
### A Cinematic Travel Landing Page

Atlas is a cinematic, full-screen travel landing page designed to emphasize **mood, exploration, and storytelling** rather than conventional tourism or booking workflows.

The project focuses on immersive visuals, restrained typography, and intentional user interaction to demonstrate how modern landing pages can communicate brand identity through motion and layout.
